        <p>Hey there Stevie, don't go out there griefing
            Saw your x-ray while you're mining
            Got them diamonds but you cheating, 'ight
            I was dreaming
            Diamonds stacking to the ceiling
            I got ores finally
            But you out here always stealing, I
        </p>
        <p>I baked this cake to save our lives, save our lives
            But you shot me with Power V, I died
        </p>
        <p>Don't mine that cave or you'll die today
            Don't mine that cave or you'll die today
        </p>

        <p>And when the game's done I play some Hunger Games
            I need an enchanted bow with a little Flame
            But my, my aiming is insane
            One shot, one kill
            Shoot you right into the face
            But please do not            
        </p>
        <p>Mine that cave or you'll die today

        <h3>Minecraft Africa</h3>
        <p>I hear the mobs echoing tonight
            But Steve hears only hissing
            Of some Creeper conversation
            He's mining with no torchlight
            The lava guides him through the cave
            Throughout his exploration
            I stopped a Villager along the way
            Hoping to spend some more emeralds
            For a diamond plate
            He turned to me as if to say
            "Sorry Steve I cannot trade with you"
        </p>
        <p>"It's going to take a lot to buy some wheat from you,"
            There's nothing that a hundred players could ever do
            I bless the diamonds down in Africa
            Going to take some time to mine the things we never have
            Ooh
        </p>
        <p>The wild wolves cry out in the night
            The parrots, they hum to the Jukebox music of their nature
            I know that I must do what's right
            Building a portal that unlocks the realm of the Aether
            I seek the cure of what's inside
            Excited to see what's in the other world
        </p>
        <p>"It's going to take a lot to buy some wheat from you,"

            Bustin' out the pick in the block

            Had to build another diamond block, hmm
            Drink up the whole potion, vision goin' crazy
            I got the Minecraft deals, I've been playin' like it's daily
            I just traded my bow, I need XP
            Told him my hunger is low, better save me
            All my enchants come in fours, feelin' wealthy
            Vibin' in Creative Mode, where is Stevie?
        </p>
        <p>Where the ores at? I want more that
            Cruise the village with the diamonds, I got four stacks (Skrr)
            Cause I know these Stevies wanna swing their sword at
            Gotta keep fightin', gotta keep climbin'
            Stevie tryna get me while I'm minin'
            I'll lay his butt down, on my sword, on my diamond
            I had the God sword with me, been fightin'
            Lotta Stevies out here hackin' and flyin'
            I done killed the dang mobs in the cave, no armor
            And I know I probably get the wheat from the farmer
            Alex out here playing with the bees, I caught her
            Got a hat enchanted, so I'm breathin' underwater
            I got the ink sac, all my TNT stacked
            Admin, I'm about to give the key to the hacker
